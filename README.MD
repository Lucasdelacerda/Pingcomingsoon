## Learning and Observations

During this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to dynamically alter styles, identify errors using Regular Expressions (RegEx), and toggle the visibility of HTML elements.

## Future Enhancements

I plan to further improve the project by adding:
- Server-side integration to store submitted email addresses.
- Email notification upon submission.
